Using the theorem:\n> \n> 3² + 4² = c²\n> 9 + 16 = c²\n> 25 = c²\n> c = √25 = 5\n> \n> Therefore, the hypotenuse has a length of 5.\n> \n> **Uses:**\n> \n> The Pythagorean Theorem has countless applications in various fields, including:\n> \n> * **Construction:** Calculating distances, angles, and sizes of structures.\n> * **Navigation:** Determining distances and directions.\n> * **Surveying:** Measuring land areas and distances.\n> * **Engineering:** Designing bridges, buildings, and other structures.\n> * **Computer graphics:** Calculating positions and distances in 2D and 3D space.\n> * **Physics:** Solving problems involving vectors and motion.\n> \n> \n> It's a cornerstone of geometry and a crucial tool for solving many practical and theoretical problems."

üìù AI-Powered Text Summarizer
A Python project that uses Google's Gemini API to summarize text using the powerful gemini-1.5-flash model. This project demonstrates how to securely connect to the Gemini API, send a prompt, and format the model's response for a clean, readable output.

‚ú® Features
Generative AI: Leverages the gemini-1.5-flash model for fast and efficient text summarization.

Secure API Key Management: Safely handles API keys using Google Colab's built-in Secrets Manager.

Clean Output Formatting: Includes a custom helper function to format the raw model output into clean, human-readable Markdown.

Step-by-Step Reasoning: Prompts the model to provide a clear, reasoned, and step-by-step breakdown of its process.
